     <h3>
      Automating Tasks with the Unix Shell
     </h3>
    </a>
    <p>
     The Bash shell has been around longer than many of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it's a
  power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes.

  More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so that they don't
  have to type the same things over and over again.

  Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including
  "high-performance computing" supercomputers, like IRIDIS at the University of Southampton). These lessons will start
  you on a path towards using these resources effectively.
